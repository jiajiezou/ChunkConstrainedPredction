# Chunking (constituency analysis) constrains word prediction

This repository contains materials for our study on how constituent structure guides word-level prediction during real-time language comprehension.

## Contents
- 'Poster_ChunkPrediction.pdf': Posters presented at **Human Sentence Processing 2025** and **CNS 2025**.
- 'Poster_SNL.pdf': Posters presented at **SNL 2025**; includes **new behavioral cloze results**.
- Partial raw data (two participants per experiment) and all associated code are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15236117)
- Preprint of the manuscript is available on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391937003_Chunking_Constrains_Prediction_during_Language_Comprehension). Behavioral cloze results were recently updated; for the most recent version, please contact **Jiajie Zou**.

## What weâ€™re exploring
- Applying constituent-constrained prediction in **cognitive models** and **LLMs**.
- Testing underlying mechanisms (**resource allocation** vs. **context management**).
- Characterizing how predictive processing **evolves over time**.
