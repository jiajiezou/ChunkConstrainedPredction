# ECoG Dataset: Scripts and Data

This folder contains scripts and plots related to the ECoG results. The ECoG dataset used in this study is an [open-access dataset](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.14.638352).

- **NeuralSurChunk_deenv_Cal.ipynb**  
  Core analysis script for processing ECoG signals and computing neural-surprisal correlations.

- **Calculated/**  
  Contains precomputed neural-surprisal correlation results.

- **NeuralSurChunk_deenv_Vis.ipynb**  
  Script for visualizing the neural-surprisal correlation results.

- **result_plot/**  
  Contains the main figures generated by `NeuralSurChunk_deenv_Vis.ipynb`.

- **intermediate_plot/**  
  Contains intermediate figures generated by `NeuralSurChunk_deenv_Cal.ipynb`, illustrating the regression of baseline auditory responses from the ECoG signal. These plots are not directly related to our main results but are useful for verifying that the regression was successful and that the baseline response has been removed.
